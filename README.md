# Command-Recognition

The purpose of this project is to train a machine learning algorithm in order to predict what word is stored in the .wav file. The dataset we used for this project can be found in Kaggle. The link for this dataset is the following: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/data. The dataset contains a test and a train directory. The train directory has other subdirectories named with the word that is pronounced in the .wav recordings (“yes”, “cat”, “bed”, “house”, etc.). Each audio file has a 1 second voice command.The dataset can be used for the tasks of classification –Keras Classification.
